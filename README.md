# MutagenesisHokC
Codes developed to compute different structural features of transmembrane and globular proteins

This site contains codes developed for the work reported at the publication entitled: "Structural basis for the increased tolerance to mutations of HokC in Escherichia coli".

All these codes were developed in java v 5 or above, so it is necessary to have installed in your computer the SDK available at https://www.java.com/en/download/. Please choose the appropriate SDK for your operating system.

To compile these codes, you need to type in your console, at the dorectory where your copy these codes the following command:

javac <codename.java>

where <codename.java> refers to the any of the codes in this directory.

After this, you should find in your directory files with an extension .class if the compilation was succesfull.

To execute these codes, you should type in your console, at the dorectory where your copy these codes the following command:

java <codename>
  
Where <codename> refers to the base name of any of the codes in this directory. Do not include any extension in this command, otherwise the execution will fail.
  
Each code comes with instructions; please follow these to execute them properly.
