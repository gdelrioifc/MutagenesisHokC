The Haussdorff distance measures how far two sets of metric space are from each other.

To compute this distance, you have to have installed the JDK (5 or upper) from : 

https://www.java.com/en/download/

Select the appropriate JDK for your operating system. 

You also need to install the Java Topology Suite distribution, available at:

http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm

Please set your classpath linked to the directories where the jar files of the JTS distribution were installed in your computer; for instance, for LINUX or Mac OS X, type in your terminal the following command:

export CLASSPATH=<path_to_jts_jarfile>:<path_to_jts_jarfile>:<path_to_jts_jarfile>:...:.

Here <path_to_jts_jarfile> refers to the full path where the different jar files from the JTS distribution are located in your computer after installation.

Once installed, you need to compile the codes provided in this distribution as follows:

javac CalcSphCoordPDB.java

javac CalcHaussdorffDistance.java

Then, execute this code by typing:

java CalcSphCoordPDB

java CalcHaussdorffDistance

The codes come with instructions on how to execute them.
