The size and order of a 3D protein correspond with the number of residues (size) and the number of contacts in the 3D space these residues make (order).

To compute this index, you have to have installed the JDK (5 or upper) from : 

https://www.java.com/en/download/

Select the appropriate JDK for your operating system. 

Once installed, you need to compile the codes provided in this distribution as follows:

javac doGraphFromPDB.java

javac calcSizeOrderGraph.java

javac GetAllSizeOrder.java

Then, execute each of these codes by typing:

java doGraphFromPDB

java calcSizeOrderGraph

java GetAllSizeOrder

Each code comes with its own instruction on how to execute them.

The compressed file named sizeorder.tar.gz contains the size and order reported in the associated publication.
