The correlated mutation index is the fraction of correlated mutations that are observed among pairs of residues that are in contact in the 3D structure of proteins.

To compute this index, you have to have installed the JDK (5 or upper) from : 

https://www.java.com/en/download/

Select the appropriate JDK for your operating system. 

Once installed, you need to compile the codes provided in this distribution as follows:

javac doGraphFromPDB.java

javac GetContacts.java

javac AnalyzeCorrMuts.java

Then, execute each of these codes by typing:

java doGraphFromPDB

java GetContacts

java AnalyzeCorrMuts

Each code comes with its own instruction on how to execute them.
